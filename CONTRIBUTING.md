### Contributing

Thanks for taking the interest in contributing to the project. Contributions are very welcome!

You can take a look at [the roadmap](https://github.com/JoelSanchez/ventas/projects/1) to find a task you like. You can also propose a task of your own  via Slack/issue/email. 

When you have choosed a task, convert it to an issue (using the `convert to issue` button) and assign it to yourself.

Then, start working on it! :) Remember to branch from `dev`. Also, remember to ask questions if you have doubts about the task or your approach to it.

PR rules:

- PRs should target `dev`
- Keep Travis happy (except if the failure is not your fault!)


- Don't reformat or refactor code that is not related to what you are doing. You can make another PR for that, but don't make PRs reformatting other people's code just because you prefer it that way.
- Try to keep PRs reasonably small and with well-defined scopes
- It's advisable to add a test for your changes, but don't feel pressured to do it (after all, test coverage is currently at 20%, maybe less...)
