### Contributing

The best way to contribute is to build a store, and report any problems you encounter or any improvements you'd like.

You can also contribute with plugins as described in the documentation.

Finally, you can contact me via Slack/issue/email if you want to take on a task from the backlog.

PR rules:
- PRs should target `master`
- Keep Travis happy
- It's advisable to add a test for your changes, but don't feel pressured to do it, as most of the project isn't that well tested anyway
