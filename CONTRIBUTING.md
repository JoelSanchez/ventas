# Contributing

When contributing to ventas, first discuss with me the change you wish to make via issue or email (you'll find my email in `project.clj`). Doing otherwise might result in wasted effort, which is never good.

If you wish to contribute but you don't know what do to, read this: [TODO](./TODO.md)
