## Documentation

ventas is not a library, but a system. Hence it does not make much sense to document it as a library. Instead, I'm documenting it doing what [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) did in the `docs` directory.

### Introduction

For now, just read the [README](../README.md). 

### Developing ventas

- TODO: Generic development workflow, gotchas, etc.

### Extending ventas

- [Endpoints - adding them, using them](./Endpoints.md)
- TODO: Components
- TODO: Entity types
- TODO: Plugins
- TODO: Themes

### Using ventas

- TODO: Production usage, link to ansible repo, explain lein template
